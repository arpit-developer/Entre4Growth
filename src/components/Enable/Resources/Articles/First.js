        There’s a lot of good news for Latino business owners in the United
        States. Twenty-three percent of Latino business owners report their
        companies have recovered and are even doing better than they were prior
        to the pandemic ( State of Latino Entrepreneurship: 2022 Research
        Report).According to a 2021 report from the U.S. Senate Joint Economic
        Committee, almost 25 percent of startups were Hispanic-owned, overall
        contributing more than $800 billion to the U.S. economy. That's exciting
        news if you own one of the nearly five million Hispanic-owned businesses
        in America today, or if you aspire to join their ranks.{" "}
